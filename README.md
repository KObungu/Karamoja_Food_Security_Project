# Karamoja Crop Yield & Food Security Analysis (2017)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops an interactive data visualization tool to analyze crop yields and food security indicators in the Karamoja region of Uganda.

Using district-level data on maize and sorghum production alongside population data, the project identifies productivity disparities, population pressure, and food availability trends to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Karamoja region faces recurring food insecurity challenges due to:

- Low agricultural productivity  
- Climate variability (droughts)  
- Uneven crop yield distribution  
- High dependence on maize and sorghum  

There is a need for structured, data-driven tools to prioritize interventions effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze maize and sorghum yields by district  
- Evaluate production per capita (food availability per person)  
- Assess the relationship between population and productivity  
- Develop an interactive dashboard for stakeholders  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Tableau Public**
- Geographic Shapefiles (District boundaries)

## 📊 Key Analysis Components

- Sorghum Yield Map  
- Maize Yield Map  
- Sorghum Production Per Capita  
- Maize Production Per Capita  
- Yield vs Population Analysis  
- Interactive Tableau Dashboard  

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Significant disparities in crop productivity across districts  
- Production per capita varies significantly  
- Higher population does not necessarily imply higher productivity  
- Strong dependence on maize and sorghum increases vulnerability  

---

## 📌 Recommendations

- Target low-yield districts with improved agricultural support  
- Prioritize high-population districts with lower per capita production  
- Promote climate-resilient farming practices  
- Encourage crop diversification  
- Strengthen long-term sustainable agricultural planning
